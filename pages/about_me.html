			Hello! My name is Moreen and I am a junior at Kyoto University, majoring in civil engineering. After reading
			my resume, some people may wonder, why civil engineering? Well, why not? I wrote my first line of HTML when
			I was in primary school, got into HTML, CSS, and iOS development in secondary school, and to this day, I
			still think of software development as a fun hobby of mine. As for civil engineering, I just think it's cool
			to work on big structures.

			In my second year of college, I was lucky enough to land my first software engineering internship. Even
			since then, my passion for software development has grown exponentially. From writing my own code to reading
			others projects, I try to learn as much as I can every day.
